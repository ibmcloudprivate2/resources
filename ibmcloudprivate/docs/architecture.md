# Architecture

An IBMÂ® Cloud Private cluster has four main classes of nodes: boot, master, worker, and proxy.

You can optionally specify management, Vulnerability Advisor (VA), and etcd nodes in your cluster.

You determine the architecture of your IBM Cloud Private cluster before you install it. After installation, you can add or remove only worker, proxy, management, and VA nodes from your cluster. You cannot convert a standard cluster into a high availability cluster, or add more master nodes to a high availability cluster.
